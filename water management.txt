CRITICAL: The current implementation is a raw simulator dump. I need a COMPLETE REDESIGN to make it feel like professional industrial software (like Wonderware/Ignition SCADA) meets modern SaaS UX (like Datadog/Grafana).

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🎯 CORE PROBLEM TO SOLVE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Make ReFlow feel like:
1. A $100K industrial software product (not a hackathon demo)
2. An interactive learning experience (judges can play scenarios)
3. A guided tour that tells our story (demo-friendly)
4. Professional software an operator would actually use

REFERENCES - Study these UI patterns:
- Wonderware/AVEVA (industrial SCADA)
- Ignition by Inductive Automation
- Grafana dashboards
- Datadog monitoring
- Tableau analytics

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📋 NEW APP STRUCTURE - COMPLETE INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

MULTI-PAGE FLOW (Not single page dump!):

1. /welcome 
   - Landing/splash screen
   - Animated ReFlow logo
   - "Launch Simulator" button
   - Version info + Quick stats (e.g., "Simulated 2.4M liters treated")

2. /onboarding (First-time experience)
   - 4-step interactive tutorial:
     Step 1: "Meet Your Plant" (shows process flow, explains stages)
     Step 2: "Monitor & Control" (highlights sensors, shows how to adjust)
     Step 3: "AI Optimization" (demonstrates AI recommendations)
     Step 4: "Handle Emergencies" (trigger alarm, show how to respond)
   - Skip button (but encouraged)
   - Progress dots

3. /dashboard (Main hub - NOT the simulator)
   - Top: Plant status card (running/stopped, uptime %, current efficiency)
   - 4 KPI cards: 
     * Water Reuse Rate: 82% ↑
     * Energy Efficiency: 1.8 kWh/m³ ↓
     * BOD Removal: 94.2% →
     * Active Alarms: 2 ⚠
   - Quick actions:
     * [Enter Control Room] ← Main simulator
     * [View Reports]
     * [Run Scenario]
     * [Export Data]
   - Recent events feed (last 10)
   - Mini trend chart (24h overview)

4. /control-room (The actual simulator - REDESIGNED)

     * Dashboard (go back)
     * Control Room (current)
     * Scenarios
     * Reports
     * Settings
   - Top bar:

   - Main area: Tabbed interface
     * Tab 1: Overview (process flow + key sensors)
     * Tab 2: Sensors (all 8 in detail grid)
     * Tab 3: Control (PID tuning, equipment panel)
     * Tab 4: Trends (historical charts)
     * Tab 5: AI Insights (optimizer, predictions)
   - Right panel (collapsible):
     * Event log
     * Active alarms
     * AI suggestions
   - Bottom: Status bar with connectivity, data rate, etc.

5. /scenarios (Interactive challenges - THIS IS KEY!)
   - List of scenarios:
     ✅ Tutorial: Normal Operation (completed)
     → Challenge 1: Handle Load Surge (locked until tutorial done)
     → Challenge 2: Sensor Failure Recovery
     → Challenge 3: Energy Optimization
     → Challenge 4: Emergency Shutdown
     → Challenge 5: Multi-fault Chaos (hard mode)
   - Each scenario card shows:
     * Difficulty (⭐⭐⭐)
     * Objective (e.g., "Maintain BOD < 30mg/L during 50% load surge")
     * Best score (if completed)
     * [Start] button
   - When scenario active:
     * Timer (e.g., 5:00 countdown)
     * Objective tracker (BOD: 28/30 ✓, Energy: 2.1/2.0 ✗)
     * Score: 87/100
     * [End Scenario] [Restart]

     * Custom Range
   - Each report shows:
     * Key metrics table
     * Trend charts
     * Pass/fail indicators
     * [Download PDF] [Download CSV] [Download JSON]
   - Preview before download

7. /settings
   - Tabs:
     * Plant Config (flow rate, stages enabled)
     * Sensor Calibration (adjust ranges, noise levels)
     * Control Parameters (PID tuning, setpoints)
     * AI Settings (enable/disable, aggressiveness)
     * Display (theme, units, refresh rate)
   - [Save Changes] [Reset to Defaults]

🎮 INTERACTIVE SCENARIO SYSTEM (GAME-LIKE)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

IMPLEMENTATION:
Create a scenario engine that:

1. Tutorial Scenario (Auto-starts first time):
   - Guided step-by-step with highlights
   - "Click here" arrows pointing to controls
   - Progress checklist:
     [ ] Start simulation
     [ ] Observe DO level for 30 seconds
     [ ] Change DO setpoint to 5.0
     [ ] Wait for stabilization
     [ ] Accept AI recommendation
     [ ] Acknowledge an alarm
   - Success message: "Tutorial Complete! You're ready to operate ReFlow."

2. Challenge 1: Load Surge
   - Initial state: Normal operation (BOD 600, DO 4.5)
   - Event at t=60s: Influent BOD jumps to 950 (factory discharge)
   - Objective: Keep outlet BOD < 30mg/L for 10 minutes
   - Hints:
     * "Consider increasing DO setpoint"
     * "AI recommends 5.2 mg/L"
   - Scoring:
     * BOD compliance: 40 pts
     * Energy efficiency: 30 pts
     * Response time: 20 pts
     * AI acceptance: 10 pts

3. Challenge 2: Sensor Failure
   - Event: DO sensor fails (shows "--" after 2 min)
   - Objective: Continue operation using other sensors + AI
   - Player must: Switch to manual mode, estimate DO from ORP/pH
   - Success: Maintain treatment quality without DO sensor

4. Challenge 3: Energy Optimization
   - Scenario: Normal day, but minimize kWh/m³
   - Constraint: Must keep BOD < 20mg/L
   - Player adjusts: DO setpoint, pump speeds, bypass valve
   - Leaderboard: Best energy score

5. Challenge 4: Emergency Shutdown
   - Event: Pump trip + high TSS alarm
   - Objective: Execute safe shutdown procedure
   - Steps: Stop feed, maintain aeration, activate bypass
   - Pass/fail: Binary (correct procedure or not)

SCORING SYSTEM:
- Real-time score display (0-100)
- Breakdown: Performance (50%) + Efficiency (30%) + Speed (20%)
- Star rating: ⭐ (60+), ⭐⭐ (80+), ⭐⭐⭐ (95+)
- Save to localStorage
